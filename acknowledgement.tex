I am deeply indebted to my advisors Chris Callison-Burch and Douglas Eck, who believed in me and my ability to conduct worthwile research long before I believed in it myself, and who encouraged me to pursue an unconventional PhD.
I am also very thankful to committee members;
I especially appreciate Marianna Apidianaki for her astute feedback on paper drafts and presentations, David Grangier for our many brainstorming conversations,  Dan Roth for his insights into the field of NLP, and Lyle Ungar for convincing me to try my hand at NLP research.
