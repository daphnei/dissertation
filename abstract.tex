State-of-the-art neural language models are capable of generating incredibly fluent English text.
In my proposed dissertation, I aim to explore how these models can be applied for creative purposes, such as story generation and building creative tools for writers.
I also address several challenges around evaluating the use of neural language models for open-ended text generation.
I propose an analysis of the tradeoff between generating lexically diverse text and text humans perceive as high quality.
I introduce a detection-based evaluation task that can be used to investigate this tradeoff as well as to study quality differences between natural language generation systems.
Lastly, I propose an investigation into the extent to which the giant language models used for text generation produce text which verbatim copies from the training set.
