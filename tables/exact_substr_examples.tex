    ,ANDREW Find the ancestral town: Many a researcher is stuck behind records that say, BIRTHPLACE: IRELAND without saying where in Ireland, or whatever other country. Remember that your immigrant ancestor's siblings probably were born in the same ancestral town, so check all o\newline{}f their records, too. Around 1900, the Roman Catholic churches reported marriages to the churches where the persons were baptised, and before the wedding, they would require a baptismal certificate from that church, without marriage notations, to make sure that the persons were no\newline{}t already married, ordained, or whatever, and were free to marry. Do check the Catholic records especially for ex loco and the home town. If your ancestor's sister had a daughter who generated a marriage or death record saying, MOTHER'S BIRTHPLACE: and the exact town, then y\newline{}ou know where to start searching for records that will confirm it is your ancestor's home town. BEWARE: Just because you find a family with the same names does not mean they are the same family, as they could very well be an unrelated family from a different town in the same an\newline{}cestral country. The webmaster has learned this. One clue was that one family was still having babies in Potenza city, Italy while the other was having babies in Colorado, U.S.A. & 2 \\
